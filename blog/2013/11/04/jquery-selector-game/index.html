<div class="entry-content"><p>I invite you to vandalize my site. <strong>Hit enter to play</strong>.</p>

<p>Ever since learning about <em>jQuery Selectors</em> I&rsquo;ve thought it would be pretty cool to make a game out of it. So yesterday I gave it a shot and came up with a functional MVP. No, really: scroll up, and hit enter to play. Instructions will appear in the address bar. (HINT: &lsquo;strong&rsquo;, &lsquo;em&rsquo;, &lsquo;p&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;.)</p>

<p>The first challenge I faced in coding this was determining if I could detect the removal of an element from the page. Sure enough, after a little bit of playing around in the console I had a working event listener.</p>

<pre><code>function listenIExist(elem){
    var $elem = $(elem)
    if ($elem.length){
        setTimeout(function(){listenIExist(elem)},600)
    }
    else {
        console.log('Vamooosh!')
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each time the element&rsquo;s selector is passed into the function it uses its length to determine if it still exists on the page.</p>

<p>The next question was how I was going to collect all the tags in the first place. My initial thought was I&rsquo;d select the document as a whole and then iterate through all the children, and the children&rsquo;s children, and the children&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s children. Easy with a recursive loop. But not very pretty. It looked something like this, and worked terribly:</p>

<pre><code>function howMuchFortheChildren(tag){
    var child = tag
    tagsArray.push($(child)[0].tagName)
    var $children = $(child).children()
    if ($children.length){
        $children.each(function(){
            howMuchFortheChildren(this)
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But then I discovered a novel solution that simplified things considerably. jQuery supports a wildcard selector. Why not use that?</p>

<pre><code>function tagAllTheChildren(){
    $('*').each(function(i,selector){
        listenIExist( $(selector)[0].tagName )
    })
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we were talking. The core pieces were in place. Except, how was I going to get user input?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d made the blinking-cursor in the header only a few days prior. It seemed almost too perfect. Forget about text fields. <em>Here</em> was an interesting challenge.</p>

<p>Using jquery&rsquo;s .wrap() and .append() methods I was able to manipulate the html around the cursor. But I also needed the cursor to move down to a new line. Since it was already wrapped in the &lt;h2> tag what I needed to do was break it into its own heading.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;&gt; begin braindump&lt;span id="blinking-cursor"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I used a trusty injection attack. I prepended a closing and opening &lt;h2> tag to the cursor. Now, instead of having one line I had two:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;&gt; begin braindump&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&gt; &lt;span id="blinking-cursor"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From there, the cursor&rsquo;s movement is just a side-effect of it being bumped over by the text to the left of it. After the user hits enter the &lsquo;field&rsquo; is cleared and the process starts over again. However this is where I hit a major bug: the backspace.</p>

<p>Hitting backspace triggers the browser to go back to the previous page in its  history. Everyone has at some infuriating moment done it. At the moment I&rsquo;ve only accidentely managed to sidestep the problem.</p>

<p>The address bar, as understated as it is, is the only safe place I could think of to display game stats. As a side-effect of updating the hash, the browser thinks you&rsquo;ve  gone to a new page. So if you bump into the backspace, you may just go back to an earlier score without the page reloading.</p>
